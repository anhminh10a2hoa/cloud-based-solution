### Create .env file and copy the content of .env.development to .env file

### Install dependencies and package

```
npm install
```

### Run the application

```
npm start
```

### Task 2:
+ When I went to the search view, is there any icon or something to go back to the project view?

+ In some cases, the color combination of the application is not good enough. For example the create placeholder/subproject/article modal, the text, the background color and the label include gray color, it hard to see. 

+ The application should have light mode (not sure it's a good idea)

+ When I sort the title or description or something else, the view is automatically move to the top, it's not a good experience (on the list view)

+ In some dialogs, there is a close and back icon that have the same function.

+ I think when we click outside of the dialog, it should close the dialog.

+ The user option pop up (on the top right site of the application) should use the diffrent color (current color is white)

+ I found 1 bug (on the left sidebar including favorites, collections, projects, ...) when I move the cursor to preferences, the scroll is hidden and vice versa.

+ When creating a new thing (subproject, placeholder, ...) it will automatically move to the created item. Should the application ask the user "Do you want to move to the new created subproject" or something like that.

+ The filtered field should use the different color to other ones like light blue (now the unfiltered filed and filtered field are using the some color). It should work the same to content type selected.
